Run the index.html page and check the project out.

The project has been implemented both on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It is fully responsive - mobile version availale.
Also, the test is IE compatible. IE9(included) onwards.

I've used SASS, HTML5 and GRUNT as JS task runner. Naming convention followed are BEM, OOCSS and SMACCS.

From the terminal, run "GRUNT" in order to compile the whole project running all tasks.
Otherwise run each task singularly.
